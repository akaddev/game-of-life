# Game Of Life

## Requirements

- PHP 8.0 or higher
- composer

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/akaddev/game-of-life.git &&
cd game-of-life &&

## Usage

### Possible restrictions

I have chosen the Unicode characters that in my opinion are most suitable. 
In case your console have encoding problems, please use `chmod +x change_symbols.sh && ./change_symbols.sh` script to change symbols. Then run `index.php`
again.
